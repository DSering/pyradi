The trianglessphere_N_M.txt and vertexsphere_N_M.txt  sets were created using meshmixer and belong together.

The B_vertexsphere_N_Moffset.txt was created by Blender, with no associated triangle definitions.  In this set the sphere is rotated around x-axis and z-axis by 1 degree to get rays off the horizon.

Please don't confuse the two sets.
